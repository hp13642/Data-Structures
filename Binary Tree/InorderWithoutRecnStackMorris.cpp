/*
Travesing a Binary tree in inorder manner without using recursion and without using stack.
Algorithm-
1. Initialize current as root 
2. While current is not NULL
   If current does not have left child
      a) Print currentâ€™s data
      b) Go to the right, i.e., current = current->right
   Else
      a) Make current as right child of the rightmost 
         node in current's left subtree
      b) Go to this left child, i.e., current = current->left
